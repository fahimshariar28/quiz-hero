            <strong>map()</strong>: creates a new array by executing a provided
            function on each element of the array. <br />

            <strong>filter()</strong>: creates a new array with all elements
            that pass a test implemented by the provided function. <br />

            <strong>forEach()</strong>: executes a provided function once for
            each array element. <br />

            <strong>find()</strong>: returns the value of the first element in
            the array that satisfies a provided testing function.

          Difference between LocalStorage, Session Storage, Cookie
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            <strong>LocalStorage</strong> is a way to store data in the user's
            browser that persists even after the browser is closed. It is not
            session-specific and can be accessed by any script from the same
            origin. The data is stored as key-value pairs and can be used to
            store larger amounts of data than cookies. <br />

            <strong>SessionStorage</strong> is similar to LocalStorage, but the
            data is only available for the duration of the browser session. Once
            the user closes the browser, the data is lost. Like LocalStorage,
            Session Storage stores data as key-value pairs and can be accessed
            by scripts from the same origin. <br />

            <strong>Cookies</strong> are small text files that are stored on the
            user's computer by the website they are visiting. They are often
            used to store information like user preferences or login
            information. Unlike LocalStorage and Session Storage, cookies are
            sent to the server with every request, which can slow down the
            website. They also have a size limit of 4KB.

          What is event loop and How it works?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            The event loop in JavaScript manages the execution of code in
            response to asynchronous events by continuously checking a message
            queue for new events. When an event occurs, the event loop pushes a
            message containing information about the event and a callback
            function onto the queue. The callback function is then executed when
            the message is dequeued and there is no synchronous code in the call
            stack.

            This function is used to choose the ans of the questions on the main
            page. If the chosen ans of a question is already given then it
            updates with the new ans and if the chosen ans is not selected then
            it pushes the ans in a array
